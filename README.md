03.	Design Principles:
•  Proximity: Related elements are grouped together to create a visual connection between them. For example, on the product description page, the product image, price, and description 
   are placed close to each other to indicate their relationship.

•  Contrast: High contrast between text and background colors is used to enhance readability. For instance, we used black text on a white background and white text on dark backgrounds in 
   headers and footers.

•  Typography: Consistent font styles and sizes are used throughout the website to maintain a cohesive look. Headings are bold and larger, while body text is kept simple and readable.

•  Alignment: Proper alignment of elements provides a clean and organized appearance. Text, images, and buttons are aligned in a way that guides the user's eye across the page 
   efficiently.

•  Repetition: Design elements like colors, fonts, and button styles are repeated across pages to provide a cohesive and familiar user experience.

•	Semantic HTML: Used semantic HTML tags such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <footer> to provide a clear structure.

•	Color Contrast: Ensured sufficient color contrast between text and background to enhance readability for users with visual impairments.
